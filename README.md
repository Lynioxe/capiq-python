# capiq-python
Thin Python wrapper for CapIQ's REST API

##Status

The wrapper is functional, but extremely thin. Would benefit from more functionality and documentation. 

###TODO

-Implement caching functionality
-Write tests

##Getting Started

Create a settings.py file and specify your CapIQ username and password as follows:

    CAPIQ_USERNAME = {{username}}
    CAPIQ_PASSWORD = {{password}}
